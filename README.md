## SummAIze
SummAIze is an iOS app that allows users to summarize online articles quickly and easily. The app uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to generate a summary of the article's main points and key takeaways. Users can input the URL of an article, and SummAIze will retrieve the text, process it, and present a summary in a readable format. The app also allows users to save articles and view summaries of their saved articles at any time. With SummAIze, users can quickly consume the information they need from articles without having to read through the entire text, making it a great tool for staying informed on the go.
